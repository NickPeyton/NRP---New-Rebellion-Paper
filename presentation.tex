            \item Largest transfer of property in English history since 1066
            \item Began in 1536 with the dissolution of all religious houses with an annual income below \pounds200
            \item Large houses dissolved under pressure through 1540
            \item Immediately preceded by \emph{Valor Ecclesiasticus} of 1535, a full survey of all Church land in England
            \item Monasteries destroyed, land rapidly sold to raise money for war

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Largest rebellion between 1381 Peasants' Revolt and English Civil War
                    \item Rebellion sparked on October 1 by Dissolution Commissioners dissolving Louth Park Abbey in Lincolnshire
                    \item Spread rapidly throughout northern England and gathered an army of 30,000 rebels between October and December 1536
                    \item Confronted heavily outnumbered royal force near Doncaster, dispersed by false promises

                \item Parish was the fundamental unit in raising and sustaining rebellion
                \item Most gentlemen involved claimed they were coerced, unclear how true this was

    \section{Discussion}
    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Discussion: Land}
        Why does monastic land predict rebellion?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Fear of changes in tenancy: inflation and rise of entry fines during 16th century
            \item Monastic recruiting shifted toward tenants and their neighbors in the century before 1536, monks did favors for family and friends
            \item Monasteries were a large and reliable source of demand for their tenants' agricultural products
            \item Median pound of land income for Northern monasteries came from less than 8km away
            \item Limited reports of monks pushing their tenants to rebel, arming them, etc.
        \end{enumerate}
        Could also be capturing some very rural population density not found in town and village population dataset
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Discussion: Musters vs. Rebel Gentlemen}
        Results may indicate a difference in motivations between gentlemen and commons:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Taxation level predicts rebel gentlemen in final specification
            \item Level of taxation does not provide information about the \emph{rate} of taxation
            \item Monastic land very weakly predicts rebel gentlemen, likely trades off directly with presence of \emph{any} gentleman's seat
            \item No map of non-rebel gentlemen, so high taxation per taxpayer may just reflect the presence of \emph{any} gentleman
        \end{itemize}

        \frametitle{Future Plans}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Taxation:} Get estimates for total tax assessment of each hundred in 1334, valuation used until Tudor subsidies beginning in 1512
            \item \textbf{Names:} \emph{Valor} data contains names of monastic officials, initial results indicate $\sim$ 1/2 of rebel gentlemen were monastic officials
            \item \textbf{Case Study:} Find sample of monasteries with good cartulary records, analyze rebellion based on tenancy turnover
            \item \textbf{Heads of Houses:} The heads of many religious houses had been replaced by the Crown in the 10 years leading up to the Dissolution; may have affected tenants' propensity to rebel
            \item \textbf{Placebo:} Find another rebellion with granular data and not too much demand for more \emph{Valor} digitization
